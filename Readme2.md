hello user. creator is not responsible if you use these bots with malicious intent
many users use my virus bots to steal digital currencies including me ( hahaha xd) this is really a joke but in my previous blog I showed you how bots work and now I will tell you about the types of stolen crypto wallets and how to open them
wallets are divided into two types in the world but for crypto exchanges there are three different types (wallets connected to HSM) the most hated long-term process
but my bots mostly steal wallets connected to HSM from crypto exchange wallets, not the bad or no scary part of this is the money is the main thing right?
I stole 6 of these wallets and waited for them to be active, it would be a long story to tell you so I'll try to keep it short and sweet. Wallets linked to HSM are dead and need 30,32,34 days to activate, at the beginning of activation the internal appearance of the wallet changes (colors and icons) at the end it appears in the internal code in the HSM wallet is being disconnected many users don't know about HSM so they open wallets and can't do anything and then they think that these wallets are fake, actually they are not fake, exchanges use HSM module to make thieves think that's exactly what they are doing to protect wallets. HSM makes wallets look fake but it is not
When it says that the HSM is losing connectivity, if the wallet code is m56.8 or m56.9 then it may be 3 or 4 days with very little time left to be active, m57 at the end means the wallets are yours (wallets fully activated). you have to wait a bit like I did, but it won't be weeks or months, it could be a day or two day but of course it depends on the speed of the HSM. if the exchange companies are in the city or state where you live, the times are no different. however, if in another country, the times shown may be different
While saying yes, you should remember that wallets never remain inactive, the main thing is to wait
i have transferred the tokens from 6 stolen wallets to my wallets i will give you my wallet addresses don't forget to donate for the info you gave me (XD) hahahaha this is a joke of course
if you hate waiting you can give me your wallet (xd)
