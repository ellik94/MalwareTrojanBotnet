hello user. creator is not responsible if you use these bots with malicious intent
many users use my virus bots to steal digital currencies including me ( hahaha xd) this is really a joke but in my previous blog I showed you how bots work and now I will tell you about the types of stolen crypto wallets and how to open them
wallets are divided into two types in the world but for crypto exchanges there are three different types (wallets connected to HSM) the most hated long-term process
but my bots mostly steal wallets connected to HSM from crypto exchange wallets, not the bad or no scary part of this is the money is not the main thing right?
I stole 6 of these wallets and waited for them to be active, it would be a long story to tell you so I'll try to keep it short and sweet. Wallets linked to HSM are dead and need 30,32,34 days to activate, at the beginning of activation the internal appearance of the wallet changes (colors and icons) at the end it appears in the internal code in the HSM wallet is being disconnected
When it says that the HSM is losing connectivity, you have to wait a bit like I did, but it won't be weeks or months, it could be a day or half a day but of course it depends on the speed of the HSM
While saying yes, you should remember that wallets never remain inactive, the main thing is to wait 
i have transferred the tokens from 6 stolen wallets to my wallets i will give you my wallet addresses don't forget to donate for the info you gave me (XD) hahahaha this is a joke of course
